I am a PhD student in Department of Industrial System Engineering and Managment, National University of Singapore. Currently, I am working on traffic management, network design, and information dissemination in the mixed traffic flow environment with connected vehicles and regular vehicles. When I was studying at Tongji Unviversity, I also worked on some optimization problems in taxipooling and 2D irregular packing.
